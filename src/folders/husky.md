# husky

Husky enhances your commits and more 🐶 woof! (description of husky docs).

We use Husky to lint our commit messages and run a prettier pre-commit hook to make sure all files are prettified. 

We use conventional commit configuration to make sure all developers obey its rules. 

You can read more about it [here](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint).
